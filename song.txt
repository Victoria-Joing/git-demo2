Comes the morning when I can feel
That there's nothing left to be concealed

Sure as I am breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

----------------------

Sure as I am breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
I leave here believing more than I had
And there's a reason I'll be

As I walk the hemisphere
I've got my wish to up and disappear
I've been wounded, I've been healed
Now for landing, I've been landing, I've been cleared
