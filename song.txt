Comes the morning when I can feel
That there's nothing left to be concealed

Sure as I am breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

----------------------


As I walk the hemisphere
I've got my wish to up and disappear
I've been wounded, I've been healed
Now for landing, I've been landing, I've been cleared

Sure as I'm breathing, sure as I'm sad
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh
I leave here believing more than I had
This love has got no ceiling
